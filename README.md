# MinorProject-Threat-Analysis
This project is a Streamlit-based web application that analyzes any website and predicts whether it is safe, suspicious, or potentially fraudulent. It uses multiple security checks — such as URL reputation, WHOIS domain details, HTTPS status, and keyword analysis — to generate an overall Risk Score for a given website.
